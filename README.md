# Minimal CloudFormation Demo Project for Integrations

## Development

### Setup

This is simple enough to get away with not needing Docker. Just use a virtual
environment and `pip`, with Python â‰¥3.6.

With builtin `venv` module:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
# Or py -m venv .venv in Windows
.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or the excellent `pyenv` tool.

```sh
pyenv virtualenv {version} cirrostratus
pyenv local cirrostratus
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run
The `cirrostratus` package is executable:

```sh
python cirrostratus
```

Which is the same as running `python cirrostratus/__main__.py`.

There's also a `.env` file and `python-dotenv` is installed by the requirements,
so all you have to do is:

```sh
flask run
```

Handy flask commands are also available: `flask routes` and `flask openapi`.

## Layout

The root, where the Flask app is created, is in `cirrostratus/__init__.py`.
OpenAPI 3.0 documentation is in the file `cirrostratus/openapi.yaml`, and
accessible with the conventional command `flask openapi`.


## CloudFormation

There is a script to produce a CloudFormation template in `cirrostratus_cfn`. Running this is simple.

```sh
# Install troposphere dependency.
pip install -e .[cfn]
python cirrostratus_cfn Cirrostratus > template.yaml
```
